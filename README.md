# Dataset_Assignment [DT228/2 - OOP]
# Description
A data visualization program that reads in a dataset and then visualizeses the data in different ways.  For this assignment I chose a dataset containing military expenditure 
for various countries over the course of 1949-2014.  The program visualizeses the data in 2 different ways. The first is a linegraph showing the progression of the yearly expenditure of all countries. 
The second is a barchart comparing the total spent by each country over the timelapse.  
  
Unlike the barchart, the linegraph comes with toggleable features:  Mouse-over Data, Linear Comparison, The Mean Of Expenses, Correlation Vs. Total Spent (All Countries), Comparison Vs. Average Spent (All Countries Each Year).

# Dataset_Assignment [DT228/2 - OOP]
This is the first OOP Assignment.

# Brief Description of Assignment
For this assignment we are required to construct a program in Java (using the Processing application) to load 
in a dataset of our choice, store the data and then visualise the data in various ways 
(Line graphs, bar charts, pie charts etc).

# Planning
I will be working with a dataset of military expenses for various countries.
The dataset lists the spending of 26 countries over the course of 60 years or so.

I plan on storing the data in 2 formats:
	<1> By Year (LineGraphs [one for each country])
	<2> By Country (Bar Chart / Squares [size depicting value, ordered Most->Least])
This will allow the user to view how the spending of each country progresses over time,  see how the
spending of each country compares to one another, and also view/compare the overall spent per year.

**Find some datasets to compare vs current. I.e. Rise of terrorist activity in america VS military expense in america etc

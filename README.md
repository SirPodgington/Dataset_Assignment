# Dataset_Assignment [DT228/2 - OOP]
# Description
A data visualization program that reads in a dataset and then visualizeses the data in different ways.  For this assignment I chose a dataset containing military expenditure 
for various countries over the course of 1949-2014.  The program visualizeses the data in 2 different ways. The first is a linegraph showing the progression of the yearly expenditure of all countries. 
The second is a barchart comparing the total spent by each country over the timelapse.  
  
Unlike the barchart, the linegraph comes with toggleable features:  Mouse-over Data, Linear Comparison, The Mean Of Expenses, Correlation Vs. Total Spent (All Countries), Comparison Vs. Average Spent (All Countries Each Year).

# Conclusion
Upon completion of this assignment I have learned a great deal in regards to writing programs.  First and foremost - Project planning is important!  For this assignment I done absolutely no planning 
whatsoever, I just kept thinking of things to do and add as I was progressing with it and as the program grew it became increasingly tedious to make the edits I wanted or to add things to X or Y. 
I had to refactor my code countless times when I ran into problems here and there, which ultimately was a pain.  I also lost track of where certain features were in the code, which added to the pain.  

All in all I am happy with how the assignment came out.  I've learnt some pretty cool data viz skills while working on it which I'm sure will come in handy in the future. 
There were some visualizations I would of liked to add to the program, along with some other features, however I was under far too much pressure trying to get it ready in 
time.  This was partly due to lack of planning, but also due to getting a late start on the assignment. Looking back now, I definitely plan on putting a lot more work into 
the planning stage, and getting an earlier start to things.
